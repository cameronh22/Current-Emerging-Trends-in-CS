# Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

In this project that I completed I was given most of the code. It was a treasure hunt game where you start at a square and the AI moves the pirate to try to find the treausre. The code that I added was to help in making the AI find the Treasure more consistently. I added code to make it remember past runs. It would then use them past runs to find what spot would be the best next one.

Computer Scientists can do many different things. There is many specializations in Computer Science. You have software developer, app developer, secuirty, data analyst, etc. There is many different things that you can complete with a CS degree. My main focus is a website designer and app developer. I want to make websites and design games/apps on the side of my job in IT Hardware and maybe eventually make a successful app or website creator company. When looking at problems as a computer scientist I look for what could be causing the problem and if I can change something that will fix it. You always want to provide the best help for your end user and you want them to be able to complete their goals with the least amount of problems as possible.
